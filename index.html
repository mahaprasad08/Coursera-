                    Based on etymology, the “Vocabolario Etimologico della Lingua Italiana” reveals that pizza comes from the dialectal pinza from the Latin pinsere, which means to pound or stamp. 
                    Other etymologists suggest it is related to the Lombardic word bizzo or pizzo, which means mouthful, and is related to the English word bite.

                    Nagreen was fifteen when he was reportedly selling pork sandwiches at the 1885 Seymour Fair, made so customers could eat while walking.
                    The Historical Society explains that Nagreen named the hamburger after the Hamburg steak with which local German immigrants were familiar

                    The word “pasta” itself derives from the Italian word for the dough from which pasta shapes are made. The names themselves usually trace back to either their creation process or objects they resemble.
                     “Spaghetti”, for example, derives from the Italian word spago, meaning string, resembling its long, straggly shape
